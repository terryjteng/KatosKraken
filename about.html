          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>
            Kato’s Kraken was founded with two purposes in mind: To serve as a
            platform for Terry Teng’s creative portfolio, and to promote two
            original game projects: <strong>Corebound</strong> and
            <strong>Big Boss Cleanup</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The studio acts as a launchpad to showcase compelling game ideas,
            production capabilities, and collaborative energy—created to attract
            future opportunities and bring these games to life.
          </p>
          <p>
            While not an established commercial studio (yet), Kato’s Kraken is a
            passion-driven, indie effort meant to spotlight storytelling,
            design, and game production talent through hands-on development and
            world-building.

          <h2>Where the Name Comes From</h2>
          <p>
            The name <em>Kato’s Kraken</em> pays tribute to Terry’s dog,
            <strong>Kato</strong>, and his favorite chew toy—a stuffed pink
            octopus. That tentacled toy followed Kato everywhere, weathering
            countless adventures and chew sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            It became a symbol of playful obsession and creative chaos—an energy
            that perfectly embodies the spirit of this fictional studio.
