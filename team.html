          <h3>Terry Teng</h3>
          <p class="role">Founder & CEO</p>
          <p class="bio">
            Terry started his career in the tech industry, but when the pandemic
            hit, he made the leap into game development to pursue a more
            passion-driven path. With years of experience managing digital
            products, he transitioned seamlessly into gaming and most recently
            served as Head of Production. Terry blends structure and
            storytelling to lead teams that build emotionally resonant,
            gameplay-first experiences.
